SOCIAL 1.4 The Constitution: Reading
The Imperial Institution
The constitution provides for a parliamentary system of government and guarantees certain fundamental rights. Under its terms, the Emperor of Japan is "the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people" and exercises a purely ceremonial role without the possession of sovereignty.  The constitution explicitly limits the Emperor's role to matters of state delineated in the constitution. The constitution also states that these duties can be delegated by the Emperor as provided for by law.
Checks and Balances
The system of government in Japan features a three-way separation of powers --- giving legislative powers to the Diet, executive powers to the cabinet, and judicial powers to the judiciary. The aim of that system is to prevent any undue concentration of power through checks and balances, which in turn helps guarantee the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens.


Relationship between the Diet and the Cabinet:
The cabinet is collectively responsible to the Diet, and at least half of the cabinet ministers must be members of the Diet. The Diet chooses the prime minister from among its members. The House of Representatives has the right to submit and vote on a motion of no confidence against members of the cabinet, while the cabinet has the power to dissolve the House of Representatives.


Relationship between the Diet and the Judiciary:
The judiciary has the power to determine the constitutionality of laws enacted by the Diet. The Diet has the power to initiate impeachment proceedings to remove a judge from the bench.


Relationship between the Diet and the Emperor:
The emperor has no power regarding matters of national government. The convening of the Diet, promulgation of laws, dissolving of the lower house, and other such actions are carried out nominally by the emperor based on the advice and consent of the cabinet.


Relationship between the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives:
The House of Councillors (upper house) and the House of Representatives (lower house) are independent of each other. The will of the Diet essentially consists of mutual agreement by the two houses. On matters of budget, treaties, and designation of the prime minister, the House of Representatives has ascendancy. That is, if the two bodies reach different decisions and those differences cannot be resolved at the inter-parliamentary conference committee level, the decision of the House of Representatives becomes the will of the Diet. Deliberations on the budget take place first in the House of Representatives.
Sections
The constitution has a length of approximately 5,000 words and consists of a preamble and 103 articles grouped into eleven chapters. These are:
* I. The Emperor (Articles 1–8)
* II. Renunciation of War (Article 9)
* III. Rights and Duties of the People (Articles 10–40)
* IV. The Diet (Articles 41–64)
* V. The Cabinet (Articles 65–75)
* VI. Judiciary (Articles 76–82)
* VII. Finance (Articles 83–91)
* VIII. Local Self–Government (Articles 92–95)
* IX. Amendments (Article 96)
* X. Supreme Law (Articles 97–99)
* XI. Supplementary Provisions (Articles 100–103)


Under Article 9, the "Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes". To this end the article provides that "land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained". The necessity and practical extent of Article 9 has been debated in Japan since its enactment, particularly following the establishment of the Japan Self-Defence Forces (JSDF), a de facto post-war Japanese military force that substitute for the pre-war Armed Forces, since 1 July 1954. Various political groups have called for either revising or abolishing the restrictions of Article 9 to permit collective defence efforts and strengthen Japan's military capabilities.
